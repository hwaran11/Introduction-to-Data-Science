# Introduction to Data Science - Week 5 Lab 8

This repository contains my **first GitHub publish**, completed during the **Introduction to Data Science** lab subject.  
It was the **only lab I published** as part of the course, marking an important step in learning version control and working with code in a collaborative environment.

## Lab Overview

**Week 5 - Lab 8** focused on working with sequences and vectors in R. The exercises introduced:
- Creating numeric sequences
- Understanding how R handles sequence bounds
- Using the `seq()` function with increments
- Creating character vectors with mixed types
